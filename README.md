# 17/27-custom-pagination

This project is all about building a custom pagination component that allows for
more control and customization over the pagination user interface.

I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to initiate the project and
will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and for styling
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).
will use [NBA Player API](https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/free-nba) for data
fetching.
